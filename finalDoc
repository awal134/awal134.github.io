Final Project-

This final project is a synthesizer that incorperates p5.js and Tone.js as well as an arduino to allow a user to 
create a multi-media performance.
The synthesizer has multiple instruments and more can easily be implemented to the user's liking
The arduino is used by passing serial input and output to and from the javascript to trigger responses from each other.
When a note is played on the keyboard, the animation on the p5 sketch changes
Playing notes on the synthesizer triggers a notes corresponding light on the arduino.
The light remains lit until another note is played. 
This pattern could easily be altered in the arduino code to the user's liking
Mapping notes to pins is accomplished through 2 JSON files.
The first maps a key to a note and the second a note to a pin.
Current implementation has C4-C5 within the JSONS, but other octaves as well as more notes on more keys could be added.
Potentiometers allow the user to adjust features of the audio output.
Current implementation allows the user to adjust the distortion of the notes
with a potentiometer, but this could be changed to modify a different effect
More potentiometers could also be added to adjust multiple effects.
